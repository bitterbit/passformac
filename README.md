# [WIP] passformac
Pass for MacOS - a thin MacOS client compatible with Pass command line application
In very early stage

# Build from Source
```bash
carthage bootstrap --platform macos

# make sure to switch Certificate under Signing & Capabilities -> Signing -> Team

# if missing libcrypto
wget https://github.com/tebelorg/Tump/releases/download/v1.0.0/openssl.rb 
```

# Motivation
pass is great but terminals dont support utf-8 well, by creating a GUI client one can now describe his acount details in any language he likes :jp::kr::cn::us::fr::es::it::ru::gb::de:ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡±
